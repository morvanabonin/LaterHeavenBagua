Later Heaven Bagua 

The octagonal trigram template is a common symbol for the term Bagua.
The template has eight (ba) areas (guas), connecting two neighbouring 
corners of the octagonal trigram towards the centre to form one gua. 
The centre contains the yin and yang symbol, or taijitu as per taoist philosophy.
Each of the �guas� shows three yao symbols, stretching in three rows from the centre to the outer side.
